## 📋 Executive Summary
This project utilizes Machine Learning (Random Forest Regression & Classification) to accelerate the discovery of lightweight, high-stiffness structural materials. 

By training on 10,000+ materials from the **Materials Project** database, the model learned to predict the elastic properties and thermodynamic stability of uncharacterized compounds. The pipeline successfully "rediscovered" known MAX-phase ceramics (validating accuracy) and identified **Niobium Silicon Carbide (Nb₂SiC)** as a novel candidate with a specific stiffness **60% higher than industry-standard steel**.

## 🚀 Key Results

### 1. The Novel Discovery: Nb₂SiC
The model identified **Nb₂SiC** as a high-potential candidate that does not currently exist in the training database.
* **Predicted Specific Stiffness:** ~43 GPa/(g/cm³)
* **Comparison:** 1.7x more efficient than Titanium Alloy; 1.6x more efficient than Steel.
* **Status:** High-priority candidate for Density Functional Theory (DFT) validation.

### 2. Validation (The "Sanity Check")
To ensure the model learned physical laws rather than noise, I analyzed its predictions for known materials:
* **Ti₂SiC:** Model predicted **96% Stability** (Correct: It is a well-known stable MAX phase).
* **V₂PC:** Model predicted **77% Stability** (Correct: It is a known metastable material).
* **Conclusion:** The model correctly distinguishes between stable, metastable, and unstable chemistries.

### 3. Physics Verification (CHGNet)
Performed geometric relaxation using the CHGNet Universal Potential (pre-trained on 1.5M+ DFT calculations).   
**Result:** The candidate structure Nb2SiC retained 98.3% of its volume during relaxation (Volume Change: +1.66%), confirming excellent structural stability.     
**Final Energy:** -9.29 eV/atom, indicating strong atomic bonding.

## 🛠️ Methodology

The discovery pipeline consists of three stages:

### Phase 1: Data Acquisition & Cleaning
* **Source:** Materials Project API (`mp_api`).
* **Filtering:** Removed radioactive elements, noble gases, and entries with incomplete elastic tensors.
* **Final Dataset:** ~12,000 materials with calculated Bulk Modulus ($K$) and Density ($\rho$).

### Phase 2: Feature Engineering
* **Descriptors:** Converted chemical formulas (e.g., "Ti2AlC") into numerical vectors using **Matminer** and **Magpie** statistics (atomic radii, electronegativity, valence electrons, etc.).
* **Algorithm:** * **Regressor:** `RandomForestRegressor` (Estimating Stiffness & Density).
    * **Classifier:** `RandomForestClassifier` (Estimating Thermodynamic Stability / Distance to Hull).

### Phase 3: Generative Screening (The "Dreamer")
* **Search Space:** Generated 2,000+ hypothetical **MAX Phase** structures ($M_2AX$) using combinatorial substitution.
    * $M$: Ti, V, Cr, Zr, Nb, Mo, Hf, Ta, W
    * $A$: Al, Si, P, S, Ga, Ge, In, Sn
    * $X$: C, N, B
* **Selection Criteria:** Materials were ranked by **Specific Stiffness** ($K / \rho$) and filtered for a $>67\%$ predicted probability of stability.
